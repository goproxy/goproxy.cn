If you're using Goproxy.cn as your Go module proxy. Then you need to know in
order to improve caching and serving latencies, new revisions may not show up
right away. If you want new revision to be immediately available in Goproxy.cn,
then first make sure there is a semantically versioned tag for this revision in
the source repository. Then explicitly request that tagged version via
`go get module@version`. After couple of minutes for caches to expire, the `go`
command will see that tagged version.
