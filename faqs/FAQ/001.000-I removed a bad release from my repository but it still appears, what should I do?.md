If you're using the [goproxy.cn](https://goproxy.cn) as your Go module proxy.
Then you need to know whenever possible, Goproxy China aims to cache content in
order to avoid breaking builds for people that depend on your module, so this
bad release may still be available in the [goproxy.cn](https://goproxy.cn) even
if it is not available at the origin. The same situation applies if you delete
your entire repository. We suggest creating a new release and encouraging people
to use that one instead.
